        <h1>HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US</h1>
        How vast beyond all measures
        That HE should give HIS only Son 
        To make a retch HIS Treasure
        How deep the Pain of seren loss
        The Father turned HIS Face away
        As wound which mar the chosen One 
        Brings many Sons to Glory
